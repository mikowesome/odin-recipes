        <h2>Ultimate Eggs Benedict Donburi</h2>
        <p>Replacing the English muffin with a konbu and shiso leaf 
        rice, replacing bacon for fried pork, and adding an extra

        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Rice</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your rice 3-4 times to remove excess starch. 
                Use your method of choice to cook the rice, 
                adding in 2g of konbu into the uncooked rice for
                 each portion you're cooking.</li>
            <li>When the rice is cooked, remove the konbu and finely 
                dice into small pieces, reserving to one side.</li>
            <li>Finely slice or dice shiso leaves or relevant herb 
                substitute. You'll need approximately 1tbsp per portion,
                 or to taste. Reserve to one side.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Japanese Hollandaise</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat. 
                In another saucepan, heat 2 cups of water over medium 
                heat until simmering.</li>
            <li>Place a heatproof bowl over the pan of simmering water,
                 ensuring the water isn't touching the base of the bowl.
                  Add the egg yolks and 2tsp of yuzu or lemon juice. 
                  Whisk to combine until homogenous, and the yolks become
                   slightly thicker and paler.</li>
            <li>Slowly drizzle the melted butter into egg yolks while 
                constantly whisking. When the butter is all added, 
                continue to whisk and cook over the simmering water 
                for 5-10 minutes or until the sauce has thickened to your
                 liking.</li>
            <li>If not using immediately, store in a heat-retaining
                 container (i.e. a thermos) until required.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tempura Poached Eggs</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Place a large saucepan filled with water over medium heat
                 until almost simmering. Add 1tbsp of white wine vinegar, 
                 stirring to distribute.</li>
            <li>Crack a large egg into a bowl. When the water is almost 
                simmering, stir the water in a circular motion to make a 
                strong vortex in the centre of the pan. Carefully pour 
                your egg into the spinning vortex and allow the water to 
                wrap the egg whites around the yolk.</li>
            <li>Drop the heat to low and cook for 6 to 7 minutes or until
                 whites have set but the yolk is still soft.</li>
            <li>Carefully remove eggs from water with a slotted spoon, 
                and place on paper towel to dry.</li>
            <li>Make tempura batter by sifting together the flour and 
                cornflour. Add the water and mix to fully combine, adding
                 more water if the batter is too thick (it should be quite
                  thin).</li>
            <li>Heat a saucepan with oil to 180C. Cover the poached eggs
                 in the batter and fry for 2-3 minutes or until lightly 
                 golden and crisp.</li>
            <li>Drain on paper towel to remove excess oil.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Tonkatsu</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Tenderise pork, season both sides with salt and allow to 
                rest for 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Coat the pork thoroughly in flour and then the egg. Repeat
                 flour and egg coating before packing on panko breadcrumbs
                 .</li>
            <li>Heat 1cm worth of oil in a high-walled frying pan over 
                medium-high heat. Test for oil heat by dropping in a piece
                 of panko, it should bubble immediately. Fry for 3-4 
                 minutes per side until golden brown and cooked through.</li>
            <li>Remove from oil and lean the tonkatsu upright in a frying 
                basket to drain excess oil.</li>
            <li>Rest for 5 minutes before using a sharp knife to cut into 
                slices.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Assembly</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine a portion of white rice with the reserved diced 
                konbu and herbs.</li>
            <li>Place the sliced tonkatsu over the rice.</li>
            <li>Place a tempura egg on top of the tonkatsu, glaze over 
                with hollandaise sauce and garnish with finely sliced 
                spring onions.</li>
        </ol>
