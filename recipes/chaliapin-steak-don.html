            <li>1 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
            <li>75 ml (5tbsp) red wine</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 tbsp water + 1 tsp corn starch (or potato starch)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Prepping Steaks</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Grate or blitz one of the white onions in a food processor
                to make a chunky paste.</li>
            <li>Wrap the steaks with cling film and tenderise using a
                meat tenderiser or a rolling pin. Beat until approx
                1.5 - 2 cm thick (approx 3/4 inch)</li>
            <li>Unwrap the steaks and score the top and bottom diagonally
                with a sharp knife. Cut lightly over the surfaces, make sure 
                not to cut all the way through.</li>
            <li>Take a plate or cointainer large enough for your steaks
                and line the bottom with half of the grated onion. Spread
                the other half over the top of the steaks and make sure 
                they're completely covered.</li>
            <li>Cover the container with a lid or cling film and leave 
                in a cool place for 30 minutes. (Don't refrigerate.)
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sauteed Onions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Finely chop the other 2 onions.</li>
            <li>Melt 1 tbsp of butter in a frying pan on medium heat.</li>
            <li>Add the rest of your chopped onions and cook until the 
                colour turns lightly golden.</li>
            <li>Once it reaches a light gold colour, add a pinch of 
                salt and stir. Continue to fry until golden brown.</li>
            <li>When it's cooked, set it aside for later.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Cooking Steak</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Scrape the chopped onion off of the steak and discard.</li>
            <li>Wash the steak under cold water and pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle each side with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Heat up a frying pan on high and once it's smoking, 
                add 1 tbsp of beef fat or oil.</li>
            <li>Once the fat is heated, add the steak to the pan.</li>
            <li>Fry the steak until it's slightly charred and flip it over.</li>
            <li>Fry for about 30 seconds and then check the softness by poking
                 the centre of the steak with your finger. Press your thumb 
                 and index finger together to make an O.K sign, for a rare 
                 steak, the softness should be the same as the palm area below
                  your thumb. Check the "doneness test" in the post above 
                  for more details.</li>
            <li>Once the steak is cooked to rare or medium-rare, transfer
                 to a plate and leave to rest.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In the same pan as you cooked the steaks, melt 1 tbsp of 
                butter on a medium heat until you can smell the butter 
                aroma.</li>
            <li>Add 1 tbsp soy sauce and cook until you can smell the soy 
                sauce aroma.</li>
            <li>Next add 75ml (5 tbsp) red wine to the sauce.</li>
            <li>The juices from the steak should have leaked out onto 
                the plate by now, pour those juices into the sauce for 
                extra flavour. </li>
            <li>Let the sauce bubble for a few minutes to burn off the 
                alcohol.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, mix 1 tbsp cold water with 1 tsp corn
                 starch and pour it into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix until the sauce is thickened and then remove it 
                from the heat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Ume Rice (Optional Steps)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut the shiso leaves into thin strips.</li>
            <li>Remove the seeds from the umeboshi.</li>
            <li>Using a knife, cut the umeboshi into small pieces until 
                it becomes a paste</li>
            <li>Put 300g of cooked white rice into a large bowl and add
                 the umeboshi paste and finely sliced shiso leaves.</li>
            <li>Mix well.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Dishing Up</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the rice into two bowls.</li>
            <li>Slice the steak meat into bite size pieces and lay them
                 on the top of the rice.</li>
            <li>Pile up the saut√©ed onion on top and drizzle with the 
                red wine sauce.</li>
            <li>Garnish with chopped spring onion.</li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
